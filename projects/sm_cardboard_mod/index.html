        When the steamworkshop for Scrap Mechanic mods openend i wanted to make a mod for the game but i didn't have any ideas on what to make, so i made

        (5/3/2017) based on my dog, it just adds a few blocks with custom textures.
        Much later when the spudgun update came out, that added spudguns and cardboard, i wanted to make a mod that added cardboard versions of all blocks.
        Because spudguns destroy cardboard blocks but only cardboard blocks.
        This is the first time that i made models in blender and actually use them in something.
        After multiple updates i added more and more until the mod is where it is today.

    <d>Maybe i'll come back to it someday and fix the bugs from the comment section, and make it so all the blocks can be crafted in survival mode.</d>
